title: "Donations"
---

I recently took the trial pledge at Giving What We Can, and
I've been donating to GiveWell. Here is my first year
of donations.

```{python}
from graph_donations import Donation, graph_donations
from datetime import date

graph_donations(
  sigma=8, # controls spread of the diffusion (in days)
  padding_days=30,
  donations=[
    Donation(date(2024, 2, 15), 5181.30),
    Donation(date(2024, 9, 16), 7318.04),
    Donation(date(2024, 10, 10), 15774.05),
    Donation(date(2024, 11, 11), 13548.43 + 6305.20),
  ]
);
```

This plot is my donations with a diffusion kernel applied
just to smooth them out.
